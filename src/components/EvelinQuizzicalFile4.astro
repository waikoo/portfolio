    CONCLUSIONS
  </h5>

  <p class="mt-[30px] text-[#001649]">
    This project was a rewarding challenge that pushed me out of my comfort zone
    into the realm of game designâ€”a field I had little prior experience in. When
    my husband asked if I could design something for his front-end capstone
    project, I excitedly took the opportunity. By following a structured design
    process and focusing on one step at a time, I was able to deliver a cohesive
    design more efficiently than I anticipated. Additionally, collaborating with
    a developer enhanced my communication skills and strengthened my
    adaptability as I navigated challenges that arose during the transition from
    design to a fully playable game.
