    WIREFRAMES
  </h3>

  <BlueBg>
    Ensuring a <strong>consistent experience</strong> across all screen sizes was
    a key priority from the beginning. I adopted a <strong
      >desktop-first approach</strong
    >, as the game is not content-heavy, allowing me to focus on every detail
    and prevent the interface from feeling sparse on larger screens. A <strong
      >center-positioned layout</strong
    >
    was selected for its <strong>scalability</strong>, providing a <strong
      >balanced and cohesive design</strong
    >
    that adapts well across devices. This approach ensures that <strong
      >users can easily transition between devices</strong
    > without needing to re-learn the layout, allowing them to focus solely on the
    game.

    STYLE DEFINITION
  </h3>
  <BlueBg>
    With full creative control over the game's aesthetics, I aimed to create a
    design that felt both <strong>playful and intriguing</strong>, using colors
    and forms to evoke curiosity. I chose an <strong
      >abstract visual style</strong
    > rather than illustrating individual categories to maintain a sense of mystery
    and engagement for the players. The design approach prioritizes <strong
      >simplicity, cleanliness, and consistency</strong
    > throughout.

      To align with the conditional rendering architecture, I designed a <strong
        >single background image</strong
      > to serve as the <strong>foundation for the entire game</strong>. This
      choice ensures <strong>visual continuity</strong>, reinforcing the
      seamless experience even as the interface changes. Since the URL remains
      static, it was crucial to <strong
        >ensure that the design transitions felt cohesive</strong
      >, avoiding any confusion that might arise from appearing to navigate to
      entirely new pages.

    COLORS & TYPOGRAPHY
  </h4>

  <p class="text-[14px] xl:text-[18px] font-['Jost']">
    The background image served as the foundation for establishing the color
    scheme and typography, <strong>setting the overall tone </strong>for the
    design. The theme blends <strong>modern</strong> and <strong>retro</strong> aesthetics
    with <strong>vibrant</strong> and <strong>sleek</strong> elements, creating a
    joyful and refreshing user experience. To enhance the playful aesthetic, I thoughtfully
    selected a <strong>variety of complementary fonts and colors</strong>,
    carefully considering their frequency and relevance within the design.

      <p class="text-[14px] font-['Jost'] mt-[11px] leading-[20px]">
        The "Play" button, as the most important element, incorporates the
        highest number of distinct colors. From there, <strong

  <p class="text-[14px] py-[20px]">
    The logo features the <strong>Monoton Regular typeface</strong> with a custom
    modification. To enhance readability and visual balance, the letter "Q" was styled
    as an uppercase character but scaled down to match the size of the lowercase
    letters. This approach was taken because the lowercase "Q" lacked the clarity
    and coherence of the other letters, <strong>ensuring</strong> the logo remained
    <strong>both distinctive and legible</strong>.

    I envisioned the <strong

    game covers. On subsequent screens, the logo was scaled down and made
    clickable, serving as <strong>a consistent navigation element</strong> that allows
    users to quickly return to the start screen. This approach balances <strong
      >visual impact with functional usability</strong
